	Alireza is a Self-taught Junior <strong>JavaScript (TypeScript)</strong> Wiz 🧙‍♂️, the apprentice of
	<strong>Frontend</strong> enchantment, spends most of his time crafting captivating user experiences
	with his TypeScript and react sorcery. But even in the realm of frontend magic, the occasional call
	of Backend wizardry beckons, leading him into a bewitching world of <strong>server-side</strong>
	sorcery and <strong>database</strong>
	enchantments. And when the workday spell is broken, you can find him conjuring cozy <strong>
    movie 🎬</strong> marathons, seamlessly transitioning from code wizard to entertainment sorcerer! 🌟
